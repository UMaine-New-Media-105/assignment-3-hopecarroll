Challenge 3, assignment 1: Using a function I created a green alien sprite to be used as the "catcher" for my game. I created the alien using the color 
"yellowgreen" with an ellipse for the head, lines and ellipses for the ears, a rect for the body and two ellipses and an arc for the face. The face 
of the alien features are black as well as the background because the alien is in outerspace.
