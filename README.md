Challenge 3, assignment 1: Using a function I created a green alien sprite to be used as the "catcher" for my game. I created the alien using the color 
"yellowgreen" with an ellipse for the head, lines and ellipses for the ears, a rect for the body and two ellipses and an arc for the face. The face 
of the alien features are black as well as the background because the alien is in outerspace. I then used the mouseX command so my alien moves back and 
forth horizontally following my mouse.

Challenge 3, assignment 2: Using an if statement I added to my green alien sprite so when the MouseIsPressed command is called the ears of my alien turn from yellowgreen to yellow when I press my mouse on the canvas. I created this function by copy and pasting my original code from the alien ears into the if statement and then adding an else statement with the same code expect for the stroke color to turn the ears yellow.
